# Student Mental Health Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the mental health conditions of students, focusing on factors such as **age**, **gender**, **major**, **year of study**, **CGPA**, and **mental health conditions**. The analysis was conducted using **K-means clustering** to identify patterns and provide insights into depression, anxiety, and academic performance among students.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Performed preprocessing on the dataset to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and normalization.
- **K-means Clustering**: Applied K-means clustering algorithm to group students based on mental health-related attributes.
- **Visualizations**: Generated charts and graphs to visualize the correlation between mental health and academic performance.
- **Insights**: Provided actionable insights on how various factors affect students' mental health and their academic achievements.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data processing, clustering, and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing data trends and clustering results.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing the K-means clustering algorithm.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-mental-health-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd student-mental-health-analysis
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset by providing the appropriate file path in the script.
2. Run the analysis script:
   ```bash
   python analysis.py
   ```
3. Visualizations will be generated, showcasing clusters and insights into students' mental health conditions.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various attributes like:
- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Major**
- **Year of Study**
- **CGPA**
- **Mental Health Condition** (Self-reported)

## Results
- **Cluster Analysis**: Students are grouped into clusters based on their mental health condition, academic performance, and other personal attributes.
- **Visual Insights**: Bar plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps are generated to show correlations and trends.

## Future Improvements
- **Extend Analysis**: Include more mental health factors like family background and lifestyle choices.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implement machine learning models to predict mental health conditions based on student attributes.
- **Intervention Suggestions**: Provide recommendations for academic institutions to address mental health issues.
